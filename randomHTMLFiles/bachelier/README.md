Friends, so this discussion will cover the Black-Scholes formula, where I'll explain very intuitively why we never use an actual formula. It's a mistake of interpretation. The prize that was given to Robert Merton and Myron Scholes for the contribution to that formula is effectively not for the option pricing formula but for the "certain" argument that makes the formula compatible with the economic theories of the time.

Much more sophisticated formulas were discovered before. In fact, the one we use is a version of the Bachelier formula. So, let me start with some chronology here with Bachelier. Bachelier, in 1900, was an option trader, and then he did a doctorate in 1900 with Henri Poincaré, the great Poincaré. His doctoral thesis was on speculative markets. Poincaré hated it, so he got in trouble and hated the thesis. He didn't have patience for these kinds of things. So, he missed out on his great contribution, both to option theory and to Brownian motion, which preceded Einstein. For a long time, nobody knew about him until Kolmogorov somehow mentioned him to someone who mentioned it to someone, and it was discovered by a collection of people that included Paul Cootner, a brilliant person who died prematurely. He was at Stanford and was one of the first people to write about the random character of stock prices.

And then, of course, we discovered the Bachelier equation. So, we use today a version of the Bachelier equation to very simply price an option. The way one needs to be from pricing an option... This is a call price. Stock at 100. Let's say I put the strike price at 100, and it's going to be priced based on a bunch of parameters, okay? We'll see what the parameters are.

What is a call? A call is simply the payoff at an expiration date, let's say at capital T. And the payoff is going to be max(S - K, 0). That's simply the option price. And for Bachelier, very simply, the expectation of that at time t=0. So, we have time t=0. I'm pricing a European option for, say, three months, capital T. I'm pricing the option here. This is what I get. And, of course, Bachelier understood very well that as time moves on, the option changes in value. He intuited some properties of Brownian motion that way, by understanding that for a period of time, the stock price, let's assume, follows a normal distribution. Let's ignore the mean, which has a mean and then has a sigma. You use sigma times the square root of time to expiration. That is very important, because if this is three months, and something is two months away, you still have this distribution, and so on.

So, how can we write the distribution very simply? The call, let's say K, is going to be the integral of max(S - K, 0) between 0 and infinity. So basically, this is a Gaussian. Five S is the probability distribution of S. Or you can remove that change of function. S minus K is going to be worth zero elsewhere, from K to infinity. So, that's simply the option price, and any modification since by the establishment has been at the level of changing what kind of distribution we have here, at two levels.

The first one is, we discovered that if S is normal, an asset at 100 has an equal probability of 150 or 50. And if you remember my discussion of logs, that's not how it works. It should be more likely to go to 50 and 200. The first modification, modification one, is from a normal distribution to a lognormal distribution. It makes sense for prices, but as you see, it may not make sense for interest rates. Why? Interest rates tend to move by basis points. So, when rates are at 100, they move up or down 25 basis points. But when they're at 600 basis points, they move up and down 25 as well. So, we notice that the Bachelier approach using a normal distribution works better.

Now, a second point is what is the mean of the distribution? For that, the answer way before Black-Scholes was already provided, a few decades after Bachelier. The machine provided by John Maynard Keynes, he discusses it in his book "A Tract on Monetary Reform." He presented it in an article in the Sunday Times of London. He said that the return of S must move as zero. The return, the mu for the stock is proportional to the lending and borrowing rates in that currency. In other words, when I take three months, so S0 times the exponential of the interest rate times T, that's the exponent, okay? So this, in other words, the three months forward has nothing to do with your expected return from the forward. It's a simple arbitrage relationship. At the time, he used GBP/USD. He said you borrow for three months GBP at, say, 10% and you place the USD at 5%. So, therefore, the differential is roughly going to be 5%. So, the forward has to adjust by 5% to the spot. For stock, it's very simple. The difference, which we call carry, very simply equals the dividend rate minus your cost of funds, which by arbitrage will flow to the one who can produce that relationship as a marginal provider, which will be the risk-free rate.

So, so far we saw two points of our Bachelier model. He used a normal distribution, not lognormal, and he didn't explicitly say anything about the mean, but he priced that way because he was a trader. And we noticed traders were pricing options using methodology similar to that, intuitively. There exists a paper by a so-called Bronzing, even earlier, that introduces the same formula. But let's say we call it Bachelier now. Bachelier is the one that inspired this generation of people to improve on the formula. And by the way, Bachelier was blackballed a second time by the great probability theorist Paul Lévy, who did the Lévy process. So, the poor guy suffered. He had a bad thesis, and when you're not supported by a thesis director, you don't get a good job. He ended up in Besançon and then some other city. If you're not in Paris, you're nobody. So, I'm glad we're talking about it now. And we'll see you after we present the Fischer Black, Myron Scholes paper, we'll see it with my argument on put-call parity with Emmanuel Derman.

So, let's take stock. But surely, pricing an option is a trivial mathematical exercise you can do longhand. The expectation of the payoff of the option at a given time to maturity, based on the process, so a second point. He used normal, not lognormal. And didn't explicitly say anything about the mean, but it was great. He priced it that way because he was a trader. And we noticed traders were pricing options...

### Technical Summary and Examples

The transcript provides an overview of the history of option pricing theory, emphasizing the contributions of **Louis Bachelier** and the later, more widely recognized, **Black-Scholes model**. The speaker argues that the core mathematical concepts for option pricing existed before Black-Scholes and that the Nobel Prize awarded for the work was not for the formula itself but for the economic framework that made it viable.

The summary focuses on two key aspects of the Bachelier model and its subsequent modifications:

* **Distribution of Asset Prices:** Bachelier's original work in 1900 assumed that stock prices follow a **normal distribution**. This is problematic because a normal distribution allows for negative stock prices, which is economically impossible. Later modifications, credited to a generation of financial thinkers, changed this assumption to a **lognormal distribution**. The lognormal distribution, where the logarithm of the asset price is normally distributed, ensures that stock prices can never be negative. The speaker notes that the normal distribution model is still useful for pricing instruments like interest rate options, which can move up or down by a fixed amount (e.g., basis points) and are not constrained by a zero lower bound in the same way as asset prices.

* **The Mean of the Distribution (Drift):** The second major point is the treatment of the mean return, or drift, of the asset. The speaker highlights that **John Maynard Keynes** provided a key insight before Black-Scholes: the expected return of an asset should be related to the **risk-free rate** in an arbitrage-free environment. This is known as the **arbitrage relationship**, which states that the future price of an asset must be related to its current spot price, and the cost of funding (interest rate) and any dividends or carry costs. This means the forward price is not a guess about future value but a function of the present price and interest rate differentials.

The speaker concludes that the Black-Scholes model's true innovation was not the mathematical formula, but rather the creation of a **risk-neutral framework** that made the model compatible with prevailing economic theory by using the risk-free rate as the mean drift. This framework allowed for the consistent pricing of options by eliminating arbitrage opportunities.

#### Examples

**Bachelier's Normal Distribution Assumption:**
Imagine a stock currently trading at $100. Bachelier's model would assume that the stock's price one month from now could be, for example, a normal distribution with a mean of $100 and a standard deviation of $10. This would mean there's a certain probability, albeit small, that the stock price could be $90, $100, or even a negative value like -$10. 

**Log-Normal Distribution (Black-Scholes Modification):**
The Black-Scholes model, and other modern option models, correct this by assuming the **logarithm** of the stock price is normally distributed. This ensures that the stock price itself is always positive, as $e^x$ is always greater than zero. So, if the log of the price follows a normal distribution, the price itself will follow a log-normal distribution. 

**The Arbitrage Relationship (Keynes's Contribution):**
This concept is illustrated with a **foreign exchange example**.
* **Scenario:** You want to know the price of a currency (e.g., GBP) in three months.
* **Arbitrage-Free Pricing:** You don't just guess what the price will be. Instead, you create an arbitrage-free portfolio.
    * Borrow the GBP for three months at its interest rate (e.g., 10%).
    * Convert that GBP to USD at the current spot exchange rate.
    * Invest the USD for three months at its interest rate (e.g., 5%).
* **Result:** The difference in interest rates (5%) tells you how much the forward exchange rate must be adjusted to prevent a risk-free profit. The forward rate is thus not an expectation of the future, but a known value based on present rates and an arbitrage relationship. The speaker extends this to stocks, where the "carry" is the difference between the dividend yield and the risk-free rate.
