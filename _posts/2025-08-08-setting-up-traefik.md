Welcome to the world of containerized applications, where the promise of seamless deployment sometimes gives way to head-scratching debugging sessions. Today, we’ll walk through a real-world debugging journey to get a multi-service application running with **Docker Compose**, **Traefik**, and a **PostgreSQL** database.

Our story began with a `docker-compose.yml` file that was meant to be the foundation of a robust, production-ready system. It included a primary database with replicas, multiple application services, and the powerful Traefik reverse proxy to handle routing, load balancing, and automatic HTTPS.

What followed was a series of common, yet frustrating, errors that taught us valuable lessons about how these components interact.

## The Initial Setup: A Comedy of Errors

Our first attempt at a modern Docker setup was a mix of good intentions and subtle misconfigurations. The goal was to replace direct port mappings like `localhost:3001` with clean, domain-based URLs like `api.pokemon.com/historical`. Traefik was the key to this transformation.

The moment we ran `docker-compose up`, the trouble began. Our `curl` requests to the new Traefik-powered URLs kept returning a mysterious `404 page not found` error.

### Lesson 1: The Traefik-Application Disconnect

The root of the `404` error was a simple yet critical mismatch: Traefik was a perfect router, but it had no idea where to send our requests. We discovered two key problems:

1.  **Mismatched Paths**: Our Traefik routing rule specified `PathPrefix('/historical')`, but our `curl` command was incorrectly using `https://api.pokemon.com/bars/historical`. Traefik routes traffic based on an exact match with the defined rule.
2.  **Unhealthy Services**: We found that all our application services were stuck in an `(unhealthy)` state. Traefik, by design, will not route traffic to an unhealthy service. This was the ultimate source of our `404` errors.

This led us to our next major challenge: fixing the health checks.

---

## The Great Healthcheck Saga

A service is considered "healthy" by Docker when its `healthcheck` command returns a successful exit code (0). Our initial healthcheck was failing for two reasons:

* **Missing Binaries**: The `healthcheck` command used `wget`, a program that wasn't installed inside our lightweight container images.
* **Missing Endpoints**: The health check was blindly hitting the root path (`/`), but our application had no handler for that route.

The solution was a best practice: creating a dedicated `/health` route in our application that would check critical dependencies (like the database connection) and return a simple `200 OK` status.

### Dockerfile Update

To ensure the healthcheck command could even run, we had to add `curl` to our Dockerfile.

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1 as base

# Install curl for the healthcheck
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# ... rest of your Dockerfile
With this change, our services could now report a (healthy) status, and Traefik could finally route traffic to them.

It’s a powerful lesson: In a containerized world, what’s on your host machine is not what's inside the container. Don’t assume common tools like curl or wget are available.

The SSL and Middleware Conundrum
Once our services were healthy, we hit the next wall: Traefik was complaining about Let's Encrypt and middleware.

time="2025-08-08..." level=error msg="middleware \"redirect-to-https@docker\" does not exist"
time="2025-08-08..." level=error msg="Unable to obtain ACME certificate... DNS problem: NXDOMAIN"
The ACME certificate error was a critical realization: you can’t get a public SSL certificate for a fake domain like api.pokemon.com from a trusted source like Let's Encrypt. For local development, we need to disable this feature.

The middleware error was a race condition. Traefik was trying to apply a redirection rule (redirect-to-https) before the rule itself had been fully defined.

Our solution was to use Traefik's static configuration file (traefik.yml). This ensures global middleware rules are loaded before Traefik starts processing individual containers.

Previous Configuration (Labels)	Corrected Configuration (File)
traefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectscheme.scheme=https	http: middlewares: redirect-to-https: redirectScheme: scheme: https
traefik.http.routers.historical-https.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt	traefik.http.routers.historical-https.tls=true

Export to Sheets
This change allowed Traefik to start correctly, and our local curl requests began to work as expected, using the --resolve and -k flags to handle DNS and self-signed certificates.

The Database Replication Breakdown
Just when we thought we were in the clear, our PostgreSQL replicas started failing with a specific error: database system identifier differs. This is a classic replication error that happens when the replicas have old data that no longer matches the primary.

The fix was straightforward but required a dangerous step: deleting the replica data volumes.

Bash

docker-compose down
docker volume rm your-project_postgres_replica_1_data your-project_postgres_replica_2_data
docker-compose up -d
This forced the replicas to re-initialize from a clean state, finally syncing with the primary and completing our stable infrastructure.

Final Takeaways and Next Steps
Our debugging journey reinforced some core principles for working with Docker and Traefik:

Debug in Layers: Start simple. Get a single service running directly. Then, add Traefik without HTTPS. Only then should you introduce the full complexity of SSL and replication.

The Logs are Your Best Friend: docker-compose logs <service_name> is the most powerful tool you have. Traefik's logs, in particular, will tell you exactly why a request failed to route.

Healthchecks Matter: A reliable healthcheck is the glue that holds a containerized system together. Without it, your services will be considered "dead," and your routing will fail.

The final, simplified HTTP setup provided a robust and easy-to-manage local environment, proving that sometimes, less is more.

The formatting has been fixed to be compatible with Jekyll's Liquid templating engine. The front matter, which contains metadata like `layout`, `title`, and `date`, is now correctly enclosed within a single block between two `---` delimiters at the beginning of the file. The original content has been preserved and placed after the front matter block.
