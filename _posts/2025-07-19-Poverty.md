### **Log: $32 and an Unhandled Exception**

**July 19, 2025 | 9:26 PM EDT**

The numbers on my banking app glow with a stark, digital truth: $32.

For most, this figure would be a catalyst for panic. It’s the stuff of cold sweats and frantic phone calls, a signifier of rock bottom. For me, it represents something else entirely. This isn’t a crisis point; it’s a destination, a familiar landscape I have purposefully, almost romantically, engineered. This is not a story of regret, but an observation of a deliberate life downgrade, and the peculiar, liberating clarity I’ve found within it.

### **The 2-Millimeter Margin**

My introduction to the boxing manga *Hajime no Ippo* came from a friend, Muhammad, who spoke with reverence about a character named Wally. A boxing prodigy, Wally’s genius was not just in his skill, but in his psychological audacity. Muhammad described how Wally would intentionally, almost suicidally, expose himself to danger. As an opponent’s punch flew towards him, he wouldn’t just dodge; he would "peek his head" into its path, closing the distance to a razor-thin margin. He was calibrating, testing, trying to find the absolute minimum distance required for evasion—a terrifyingly precise two millimeters.

This wasn’t recklessness. It was an act of profound, calculated risk. In my former life as a software engineer, we called this “edge-case testing”—pushing a system to its absolute limits to understand its true boundaries. Wally was testing the edge cases of his own physical reality.

This philosophy has been my operating system for as long as I can remember. My life has never been about accumulating wealth or possessions. I am a reluctant participant in consumer culture, and any item I do acquire must first survive a rigorous process of due diligence. I research its components, manufacturing, and long-term value until I often know more about it than the person selling it to me. This meticulous approach is about understanding the mechanics of a situation, knowing the precise "2-millimeter" margin of risk, and operating with an awareness most would call excessive. It’s about mastering the line, not just staying safely behind it.

### **The Architecture of Happiness**

It may sound masochistic, but my most vivid memories are not of prosperity. They are tethered to periods of profound simplicity—what most would call "being broke and alone." I often think of 2016, a year I spent artfully stretching a modest tax refund. There was a sublime freedom in that time. No external pressure to earn more, a daily spend so low it was almost zero.

Even as my career advanced and my income grew, that romanticized notion of "poverty" remained. It was never a desire for true destitution, but a compelling urge to revisit that state of lean resourcefulness, to run the experiment again: how close can I get to the financial edge without falling?

Each time, it’s a re-calibration of my needs versus my wants. My experience consistently shows that happiness isn't bought; it's engineered. For me, the architecture of that happiness is built on a foundation of financial independence—a state I feel most acutely when my monetary resources are at their lowest. With less, the external pressures and perceived obligations of the world simply fall away. There is a profound power in knowing you can subsist on very little, and that your well-being is not tethered to a perpetually inflating bank account.

### **The Third Place**

My immediate challenges are primal: "Where do I go?" and "What do I eat?" When I lost my job, the situation was not a surprise. My preparations for this exact scenario were already underway. Circumstances and planning converged to provide a few crucial tools.

The most important is a simple beach chair. Its value is not just in comfort, but in what it represents: an anchor in my "third place." The concept is simple—a space that is neither the obligation of "work" nor the responsibility of "home." It is a place of freedom from judgment and demands.

In programming, a standard `try-catch` block handles expected outcomes. Work is "try," home is "catch." This third place is where you go when you refuse to be handled by the system at all. My old world of tech was built on abstract money and, often, an invisible structure of suffering that everyone agreed to deny. My path is a deliberate divergence. To choose a third option. To simply "subside" and trust that I can provide my own fundamental necessities, freeing myself from the exhausting cycle of accumulation. This beach chair is my physical claim to that autonomy.

### **The Logistics of a Downgrade**

In practice, this life is a daily exercise in ingenuity. I’ve ironically taken on a semi-managerial role in the fast-food industry. The establishment will remain my secret for now.

My survival toolkit is lean: a portable grill, a hammock for versatile rest, a small saw, and a durable canteen. Storage is a constant puzzle, currently solved by a 7-gallon hardware store bin. I’ve found that unofficial dumping sites, where things tend to accumulate, can become rather convenient storage hubs. ![im happy are you](assets/img/poverty/04.jpg)

Food remains the most persistent challenge. It costs about $20 a day to sustain me. My initial funds, which I projected would last seven weeks, have burned much faster. This new job, which I genuinely enjoy, is therefore a strategic necessity. Paired with my long-standing practice of intermittent fasting, it's a solvable equation. The goal is to maintain this adaptable existence, leveraging the kind of mobility and freedom my old career promised but never truly delivered.

This is my current reality. The $32 isn't a bug; it's a feature. It's the parameter that forces ingenuity. It’s the feedback that proves the system works. Most lives are scripted to avoid this state, to catch the error before it can halt the program. But I'm choosing to live at that 2-millimeter margin, to see what happens when you don't just dodge the punch, but lean into it to understand its power. I'm choosing to see what can be built not from abundance, but from the elegant logic of scarcity.

In a world that demands everyone fit into a predictable routine, maybe the most liberating act is to be the one thing the system was never designed to handle.
